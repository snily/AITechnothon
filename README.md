Problem Statement
“Develop an Auto Release Notes solution that leverages Git commits and AI generation to
automatically generate tabular release notes. The current process of creating release
notes involves manual extraction from Jira or other sources, leading to inefficiencies. The
solution aims to automate this process by analyzing Git commits and utilizing AI
technology to generate comprehensive release notes in a tabular format. By automating
the release notes generation, the solution aims to save time and effort, ensuring accurate
and consistent documentation of software releases.”

Solution Overview
The Auto Release Notes solution will automate the process of generating release notes
by leveraging Git commits and AI generation. The solution will consist of several
components that work together to extract relevant information from Git commits,
analyze the data, and generate comprehensive release notes in a tabular format. Here's
an overview of the solution components: 1. Data Extraction: The solution will connect to the Git repository and retrieve the
commit history. It will extract information such as commit messages, author,
timestamp, and associated files. (We can use GitPython, a Python library, to interact with the Git
repository programmatically.) 2. Data Analysis: The extracted commit data will be analyzed to identify relevant
changes and categorize them based on their impact on the software. This
analysis may include techniques like natural language processing (NLP) to
understand the semantic meaning of commit messages and code diff analysis to
identify modified files and their significance. (For example, we can use a simple keyword-based approach to categorize commits into different types (e.g., bug fix, feature, enhancement).) 3. Release Notes Generation: Using AI generation techniques, the solution will
process the analyzed data and generate release notes in a tabular format. The
release notes will include details such as the type of change (bug fix, feature,
enhancement, etc.), the associated files or components, a brief description of the
change, and the author. (We can utilize libraries like OpenAI's GPT-3 or
GPT-Neo for this purpose. Note that we'll need appropriate API keys and
credentials to access the AI models.) 4. Customization and Formatting: The solution will provide options to customize
the content and format of the release notes. Users can choose specific
information to include or exclude, define the table structure, and apply styling or
branding elements to the generated release notes. (you can define parameters in the functions for
content and formatting customization. For example, you can allow users to choose specific information to include in the release notes, define table) 5. Integration and Delivery: The solution will provide integration capabilities to seamlessly deliver the generated release notes to various channels or systems. This may include sending the release notes via email, publishing them to a documentation platform, or integrating with project management tools like Jira.

To integrate and deliver the generated release notes, we can leverage various libraries or APIs depending on your preferred channels or systems. For example, you can use the smtplib library in Python to send release notes via email, or you can utilize APIs provided by project management tools like Jira to automatically update the release notes there.

Benefits: 
    1. Time and Effort Saving: By automating the release notes generation process, the
solution eliminates the need for manual extraction from Jira or other sources.
This saves valuable time and effort for development teams, enabling them to
focus more on actual development tasks. 
    2. Accuracy and Consistency: The AI-based analysis ensures accurate identification and categorization of changes, reducing the chances of human
errors or omissions. The generated release notes maintain consistency in format
and content, enhancing the overall quality of documentation. 
    3. Real-time Updates: The solution fetches the latest commit data from the Git
repository, allowing for real-time updates of release notes. This ensures that the
release notes always reflect the most up-to-date information about the software
changes. 
    4. Customizability: Users can customize the release notes according to their
specific requirements, tailoring the content, format, and styling as needed. This
flexibility enables teams to align the release notes with their internal processes
and branding guidelines.

Overall, the Auto Release Notes solution streamlines the release notes generation
process, improving efficiency, accuracy, and consistency. It empowers development
teams to document software releases effectively, enabling stakeholders to stay
informed about the changes and improvements in the software.
